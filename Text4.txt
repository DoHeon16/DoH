Prettymuch - Summer on you
Baby, I ain't got no money
All I got is time and
I'm gon' spend that time on you
But when they pay me
And I can buy the sunshine
Take you away, we'll drink champagne
While holed up in a room
Darling, I've been working all week
I got so much on my plate, always sayin', poor me
Although my boss is an A-hole, that's when you call me
Said you've been makin' a plan to hit the road with me
I'll pick you up after and
We'll hit the coast on the late night
Make love till daylight
I love it when you play with my hair
You know it feels so nice
And I'll do what you like
Naked in the moonlight
We don't care if we are broke
When love is all we own, I'm singin'
