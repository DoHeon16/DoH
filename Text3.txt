Slchld - She likes spring, I prefer winter
Stay by the fire
You're givin' looks like you're tellin' I'm faded
It's cold outside
But spring's in the corner and I'm waitin'
On the way to work, she saw the flower bloomin' up
Tellin' me how winter sucks for you
What more that I can do?
We know we met this year, last season
That's why it's memorable for me
We've worked so hard to where we'd be
And that's enough for me right now
What you've been dying to see
But you be that flower for me
I prefer marigold
But it's the lily from the valley that you want
What you've been dying to see
But you be that flower for me
I prefer marigold
But it's the lily from the valley that you want
But I'd be so glad if I'm having you, yeah, yeah
For this moment
For this moment
